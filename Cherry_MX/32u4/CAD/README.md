About the switchplate: while optional, a switchplate can add weight to your keyboard, while also protecting the PCB from debris. It should be 1.5 mm Â± 0.1 mm, and can be made out of any material, although I recommend metal for that. Stainless steel is my preferred material, you can have the plate custom cut on sites like [Laserboost](https://www.laserboost.com/), [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/), among others.

All dimensions are in mm.
