A simple keyboard to move your 3D printer toolhead. The layout of both the keyboard and the custom keycaps is heavily inspired on [Pronterface](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun). This keyboard is meant to be used with [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper), taking advantage of its multi-microcontroller capabilities.

This is the source for the keyboard that uses Cherry MX or clones switches *and* a Raspberry Pi Pico board with the RP2040 microcontroller. This is the preferred version if you don't have some ATmega32U4-AU microcontrollers available at hand.
